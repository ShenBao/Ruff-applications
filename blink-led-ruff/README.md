# Get Started with Ruff Application

This repo contains the source code to help you be familiar with developing an application on Ruff platform. The application would blink RGB LED (KY-016) in Ruff board for 20 times, each of which it lasts for 200 ms.

We hope you enjoy the process. Please provide feedback if there's anything that we can improve.
